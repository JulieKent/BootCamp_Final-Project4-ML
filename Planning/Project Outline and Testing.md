Project 4 - ML - Outline

1. Data Preparation for Machine Learning:
Cleaning and preprocessing of data for machine learning model development.
Handle missing values, outliers, and other data anomalies.
Transform categorical variables (e.g., media type) into numerical representations.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2.  Machine Learning Model Development:
Random Forest as the supervised learning algorithm for predicting call volumes.
Define the target variable (call volume by media type) and predictor variables (DIFOT %).
Train the Random Forest model using the training dataset. Validate the model. 

3. Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Identify any areas for improvement and fine-tune the model if necessary.

4. Normalisation for Visualisation:
Normalise the model outputs for use in visualisations in Tableau.
Ensure the compatibility of the machine learning model results with the visualisation tool.

5. Analysis 2 - Correlation Analysis:
Use the data from Analysis 1 to perform correlation analysis.
Examine the relationship between call reasons and media types.
Identify patterns and trends that can inform self-service capability improvements.

6. Result Visuals:
Create visualisations to represent the correlation findings.
Utilise Tableau to develop interactive dashboards for easy interpretation.
Highlight key insights and areas for improvement.

7. Conclusion:
Summarise the key findings from both analyses.
Discuss the implications for resource allocation, SLA adherence, and self-service improvements.
Recommend actionable steps based on the results.

8. Future Work:
Propose potential areas for further analysis and refinement of the model.
Consider ongoing monitoring and updating of the model as new data becomes available.

##########Some ideas to consider predicting future call volumes based on historical data for testing; ###############

### Time Series Forecasting:
Factor in seasonality, trends, and any other relevant patterns in the data.

### Call Arrival Rate Prediction:
Analyse patterns in historical data and incorporating external factors like time of day, day of the week, or special events.

### Average Handle Time Prediction:
Consider features such as the type of inquiry, customer information, and historical data on handling times.

### Agent Absence Rate Prediction:
Predict the absence rate of agents. Consider factors such as holidays, weekends, and historical absence patterns.

### Agent Utilisation Modelling:
Calculate agent utilisation rates based on historical data. This involves considering the number of agents available, call volumes, and average handle times to determine how efficiently agents are utilised.

### Staffing Requirement Calculation:
Combine the predicted call volumes, average handle times, and absence rates to calculate the required number of agents for each interval. 

### Machine Learning Regression Models:
Train regression models using features such as historical call volumes, average handle times, and absence rates to predict the number of agents needed.
